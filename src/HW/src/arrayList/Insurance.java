//Create a class Insurance that will have an attribute as insuranceName and unimplemented behaviour as
// getQuote and cancelInsurance. Create 3 subclasses Car, Pet, Health. Car class has itâ€™s own attribute as
// carModel and Class Pet has petType attribute. Create 3 objects of the sub classes and store them in ArrayList.
// Using for loop/advanced for loop/ iterator access all methods of the class.
// Create a Card class that will have interest rate field and card type
//  and a constructor that will initialize the fields.
//  Create 3 objects of different card and store them into LinkedList.
//  Using for loop/advanced for loop/ iterator access all methods of the class.
